# Code for Sacramento Project Intake
Code for Sacramento hearts community. We use civic tech to improve quality of life. And we want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems. 

Interested in getting involved? This is the place to get started.

We know what you're thinking, "What the heck is a GitHub?" Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. We don't know where the word *git* came from either. But apparently this is a hub for git. All kidding aside, here's what you need to know...

Code for Sacramento is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) organization. We make software freely and openly available. GitHub is our platform of choice. Think of it as collaboration + technology. There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called *Issues*.

### How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas
[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/code4sac/projects/issues/new). You'll need a title and description. Then, someone from the Code for Sacramento Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback. 

GitHub is the platform we're using to collect ideas, vet ideas, and convert those ideas into active projects. Once a project becomes active, a new *repository* on GitHub will be created where all subsequent conversations about that project will live. We'll continue to use the Issues feature to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project.

### TL;DR (too long; didn't read)

#### >> [View Projects Under Active Development](http://codeforsacramento.org/projects/)

Thanks for co-creating with us!

### Note for Delivery Leads
Once a project becomes active, be sure to close the issue and add the repo to our [Code for Sacramento Projects List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5gff8Mvs6rb3sz6aLll5Dq8joftl65Gmy33DO-7Kv8/edit#gid=0) so that it populates on our website's Projects page.
