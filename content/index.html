    <p>Code for Sacramento hearts community. We use civic tech to improve quality of life. And we want to help citizen,
      government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems. </p>
    <p>Interested in getting involved? This is the place to get started.</p>
    <p>We know what you&#39;re thinking, &quot;What the heck is a GitHub?&quot; Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not as scary
      as it
      sounds. We don&#39;t know where the word <em>git</em> came from either. But apparently this is a hub for git. All
      kidding aside, here&#39;s what you need to know...</p>
    <p>Code for Sacramento is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> organization. We
      make
      software freely and openly available. GitHub is our platform of choice. Think of it as collaboration + technology.
      There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called <em>Issues</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="how-to-propose-or-discuss-project-ideas">How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas</h3>
    <p><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a> work just like any other commenting system
      on
      the Internet. First, you&#39;ll need to <a href="https://github.com/join">create an account</a>. Then you have two
      options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. &quot;issue&quot;), or (2) create a new idea.</p>
    <p>If you see an idea that you&#39;re interested in, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to
      the
      bottom of the discussion thread. If you don&#39;t see the idea you have in mind, <a
        href="https://github.com/code4sac/projects/issues/new">add a new one</a>. You&#39;ll need a title and
      description.
      Then, someone from the Code for Sacramento Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback. </p>
    <p>GitHub is the platform we&#39;re using to collect ideas, vet ideas, and convert those ideas into active projects.
      Once a project becomes active, a new <em>repository</em> on GitHub will be created where all subsequent
      conversations
      about that project will live. We&#39;ll continue to use the Issues feature to flag obstacles, opportunities, and
      answer questions about that specific project.</p>
